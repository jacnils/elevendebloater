## elevendebloater 1.0

Windows "debloater" specifically for Windows 11 (now with 10 support) that relies on the App Installer and "winget".

## Pros
- Very easy to customize depending on what you want to delete & what to keep
- Can easily be fixed when more shit is added to Windows 11.
- Batch script so the "source" is always public
- Now allows easy reinstallation of deleted apps
- Doesn't require admin if you manually enable it

## Cons
- Requires modification to the script if you want customization
- Maybe (definitely) bad code

### Before running
Please run "winget list" in CMD and accept the terms. Otherwise nothing will be uninstalled.
Actually 0.95 may have fixed this problem by doing it automatically. Still try this if you can't get it to work!

### How to use
Download the latest script from well, the latest release and run it. Then just follow the on screen instructions.

### Configuring
Elevendebloater allows you to change some basic settings. Do this by editing the script directly. See the comments at the top.
