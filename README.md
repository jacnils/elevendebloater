Kinda terrible "debloater" for Windows 11 that relies on the App Installer and "winget"
Made this just because I had some free time and was fucking around with 11 build .100

## Pros 
*Very easy to customize depending on what you want to delete & what to keep
*Can easily be fixed when more shit is added to Windows 11.
*Batch script so the "source" is always public
*Doesn't require admin

## Cons 
*Doesn't work with Windows 10 and earlier unless you manually install winget (will include an installer later)
*Not as good as the M$ Powershell debloater by another legend :)
*Requires modification to the script if you want literally any customization
*Maybe messy
